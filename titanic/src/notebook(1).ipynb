Question or problem definition.\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n7. Supply or submit the results.\n\n## Question and problem definition\n\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\n\n Here are the highlights to note:\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nBelow is all you need to import for this to work so make sure you can import everything.",

This is necessary due to deficiency of training data which could and in this case does lead to Overfitting.\nRegularization is added in the form of Dropout Layers mingled between the Dense Layers\nYou may try to experiment with the ordering and number of layers to get the best output\nSo, Try playing Lego a bit with them and try to find something interesting.\nLet me know if you do ;) ",
